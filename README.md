In this project we used two Machine Learning algorithms namely, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to support a Pairs Trading strategy on High-Frequency Data (HFD) from a set of 2365 stocks. The data came from NYSE Trade and Quote (TAQ) database which contains intraday transactions for all securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and American Stock Exchange (AMEX), as well as Nasdaq National Market System (NMS).
